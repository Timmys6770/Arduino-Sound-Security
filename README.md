# Arduino Sound-Based Security System  

## Overview  
This project detects glass breaking sounds using a TensorFlow Lite model and triggers an Arduino-based security response with LEDs.  

## Requirements  
- **Hardware:** Arduino, LED lights, keypad, microphone  
- **Software:** Arduino IDE, Python 3.9, TensorFlow Lite, PySerial, Sounddevice  

## How to Run  
1. Upload `security_system.ino` to your Arduino.  
2. Run `sound_detection.py` in Python.  
3. If glass breaking is detected, the system will activate security LEDs.
